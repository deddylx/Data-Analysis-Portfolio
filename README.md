# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Deddy! I have an analytical background in Architecture and a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making. My experience spans roles as a Junior Architect, Site and Program Analyst, Market Research Analyst, and Building and Housing Engineer, where I honed my skills in performance monitoring, data analysis, and problem-solving.

Through my work, I have developed a keen ability to interpret complex data, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights. My expertise in program analysis, market research, and performance monitoring has strengthened my proficiency in data visualization, reporting, and strategic decision-makingâ€”essential skills in the field of data analytics.

I am excited to transition into a data analyst role, where I can apply my technical and analytical abilities to uncover meaningful insights and drive informed business decisions. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools, working on personal projects, and continuously expanding my knowledge in data science and analytics. Whether collaborating in a team or working independently, I am driven by curiosity and the challenge of solving complex problems through data.

This repository serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills, share projects, and keep a record of my growth in Data Analytics / Data Science.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will showcase data analytics projects with a brief overview of the technology stack used to address each case, along with links to my GitHub repositories containing codes.

### Paid Search Campaign Analysis
- **Description:** Conducted analysis in SQL and Python to uncover insights on campaign performance and customer engagement for a Kaggle-derived Shopping Mall Paid Search Campaign dataset containing a 5-months ad records. Worked independently for two weeks to clean, transform, and analyze the data, identifying key metrics such as click-through rates (CTR), cost-per-click (CPC), and return on ad spend (ROAS). Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize trends related to campaign performance and ad spend efficiency. 
- **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization
- **Technology:** PostgreSQL, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tableau

### Used Car E-Commerce Platform
- **Description:** This project focuses on building a relational database for a used car sales website. The database will allow users to post advertisements for their used cars and enable potential buyers to search for vehicles based on specific criteria such as brand, model, year, price, and mileage. This project demonstrates the application of SQL in designing and managing a database for a real-world e-commerce platform.
- **Objectives:** to create a structured and efficient system for managing user data, advertisements, and search functionalities, ensuring a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers.
- **Skills:** DDL (Data Definition Language), DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language)
- **Technology:** PostgreSQL
