# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Deddy! I have an analytical background in Architecture and a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making. My experience spans roles as a Junior Architect, Site and Program Analyst, Market Research Analyst, and Building and Housing Engineer, where I honed my skills in performance monitoring, data analysis, and problem-solving.

Through my work, I have developed a keen ability to interpret complex data, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights. My expertise in program analysis, market research, and performance monitoring has strengthened my proficiency in data visualization, reporting, and strategic decision-makingâ€”essential skills in the field of data analytics.

I am excited to transition into a data analyst role, where I can apply my technical and analytical abilities to uncover meaningful insights and drive informed business decisions. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools, working on personal projects, and continuously expanding my knowledge in data science and analytics. Whether collaborating in a team or working independently, I am driven by curiosity and the challenge of solving complex problems through data.

This repository serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills, share projects, and keep a record of my growth in Data Analytics / Data Science.
